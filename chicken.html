            <ol type="1">
              <li><p>First gather your ingredients, cut the chicken into cubes. I prefer bone-in chicken thighs
                becuase they stay soft longer then chicken breast. You can buy ginger garlic paste at store
                or grind equal parts ginger and garlic it can be kept in the fridge for up to a week.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <div class="grid-container">
                  <div class="grid-child"><p>Next add the chicken to a bowl, and combine 1 tbsp of ginger-garlic paste, 1/2 tsp turmeric powder, 
                  1 tsp red chili powder, 1 tsp garam masala, 1 tsp coriander powder, and 1 1/2 tsp salt. 
                  As well as the juice from half a lemon. Mix and cover with plastic wrap and set aside for about 20 min or up to two hours. 
                  I find the longer you let it marinate the better it tastes but you should be fine with 20 min as well.</p></div>

                  <div class="grid-child"><p>Heat up the oil in the pot and add 1 tsp cumin, 1 bay leaf and sauté for 30 secs on low heat. 
                  Then add the green chilies and diced onions and continue sautéing on medium heat until the onions start 
                  to soften and look translucent for about 10 min. Just make sure to stir every couple of minutes and make 
                  sure that the onions don&OpenCurlyQuote;t start to brown too much.</p></div>

              </li>
              <li><p>Add another tsp of ginger-garlic paste to the onions and sauté on medium heat for another 5 min. 
                Add the chicken mixture and mix with onions and cook on medium-low heat for another 2-3 mins.</p>

                <div class="grid-container">
                  <div class="grid-child"><p>Add about 1/4 cup of water or just enough to cover the chicken, add cilantro, mint, and a little bit of salt to the pot, 
                  stir and cover then cook on medium heat for about 10-15 min until the chicken is tender. During this step you can also add 
                  some more red chili powder if you want to make it spicier. I grew up eating a lot of spicy food so I generally do this.</p></div>

              <div class="grid-container">
                <div class="grid-child"><p>Finally, uncover and taste and add salt as needed. Then cook off any excess water until curry reaches desired consistency. 
                This should take about 10 min but it depends on how much water you added. You want it to not be too watery but also not too thick.
                It normally served with rice or naan which is a type of bread.</p></div>
